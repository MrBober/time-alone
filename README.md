# Time alone
This program counts how many seconds you are alone and notifies you about it. 

It's pretty inaccurate cause I just used `sleep` function.
Works only on Linux.

## Dependencies
Dependencies are `glib2` and `libnotify`

## Compiling
First clone the repository and `cd` into it.
```
git clone https://github.com/MrBober/time-alone
cd time-alone
```
Then run make command.
```
make
```
